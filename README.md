# Model drift detection using explainability algorithms
> Juan Carlos Ruiz Ruiz

## Introduction
This is the final work from the Master in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence imparted by the University of Malaga.

This project is based on the idea of using explainability algorithms to detect model drifting in on-line prediction models. It explores the use case of the forecasting of tourists in the province of Malaga and we develop a methodology to test a model and detect if it is drifting.

## Installation

### Prerrequisites
* Python 3.10 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook

### Local installation

There is no need to install any specific technology. The code may be found in the Jupyter Notebook [regression_tourism_final.ipynb](https://github.com/JCruiz15/explanable-model-drift/blob/main/scripts/regression_tourism_final.ipynb).

To use this code locally clone this repository and open the notebook desired:
```
git clone https://github.com/JCruiz15/explanable-model-drift
```
